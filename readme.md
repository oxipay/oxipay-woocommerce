# Oxipay Woocommerce Plugin

# Development environment

Setting up your own wordpress can be done in a variety of ways. 

At oxipay, we use our own vagrant box / docker steup. If you would like toi use that, please request access to https://github.com/oxipay/plugin-IAC from mailto://devadmin@oxipay.com.au and use the /wordpress directory with vagrant. By following the instructions there you can then symlink/junction/clone your local copy of this directory in to /www/wp-content/plugins
